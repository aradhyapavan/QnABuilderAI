# QnABuilderAI

Generate high‚Äëquality questions (MCQs, short Q&A, descriptive) directly from uploaded PDFs. QnABuilderAI chunks PDF pages, embeds them with sentence‚Äëtransformers, indexes content in FAISS, detects topics, and uses an LLM (Mistral) via an agentic flow to synthesize questions. Results can be downloaded as CSV or a polished PDF.

## ‚ú® Features
- Upload a PDF and restrict processing to a page range
- Configurable chunking strategy and size/overlap
- Embeddings with `all-mpnet-base-v2` and FAISS inner‚Äëproduct retrieval
- Topic auto‚Äëdetection (with retry + throttling safeguards)
- Question generation by type and difficulty using Mistral
- Export results to CSV or a styled PDF
- Hugging Face Spaces friendly (Flask app served in an iframe)

## üß± Tech Stack
- Backend: Flask, Python 3, Werkzeug
- AI/Agents: `mistralai`, `phidata`
- Embeddings/RAG: `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-cpu`, `langchain` splitters
- PDF: `pypdf`
- Export: `reportlab`

## üìÇ Project Structure
```
QnABuilderAI/
  app.py
  requirements.txt
  templates/
    index.html

    configure_chunking.html
    select_pages.html
    manage_topics.html
    select_questions.html
    results.html
  uploads/
  faiss_indices/
```

## üîê Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file next to `app.py` with:
```
SECRET_KEY=change_this_in_production
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
PORT=7860
```

## üöÄ Run Locally
1) Create and activate a virtual environment, then install deps:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2) Start the app:
```
python app.py
```
3) Open the app at `http://localhost:7860`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run on Hugging Face Spaces
This repository is compatible with Spaces (Docker). See the Spaces config reference: `https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-config-reference`.

## üß≠ User Flow
1) Upload PDF ‚Üí 2) Configure chunking (optional) ‚Üí 3) Select page range ‚Üí 4) Process PDF (embeds + FAISS) ‚Üí 5) Review auto‚Äëdetected topics and/or add your own ‚Üí 6) Choose question types and counts per difficulty ‚Üí 7) Generate ‚Üí 8) Download CSV/PDF.

## üîå Key Endpoints (Flask)
- `/` Home
- `/upload` Upload a PDF
- `/configure-chunking` Adjust chunk size/overlap and strategy
- `/select-pages` Pick start/end pages (capped to 30 pages per run)
- `/process-pdf` Build/extend FAISS index for the selection
- `/manage-topics` Auto‚Äëdetect topics; add/curate topics
- `/select-questions` Choose types and counts by difficulty
- `/results` Generate questions and display
- `/download/<format>` Export CSV or PDF (`format` = `csv` | `pdf`)

## üß† How It Works (High‚ÄëLevel)
1. Parse PDF pages with `pypdf` and split text using LangChain text splitters (configurable).
2. Create embeddings via `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and store normalized vectors in FAISS (inner product).
3. Concatenate content for topic detection and prompt the LLM (Mistral) with concise instructions; throttle and retry to avoid API limits.
4. For each selected topic, generate requested question types and difficulties using structured prompts.
5. Render results in the UI and enable export (CSV or a styled PDF via ReportLab).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Update defaults in `app.py`:
- `CHUNK_SIZE`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, `CHUNKING_STRATEGY`
- API rate limits in `API_RATE_LIMIT`
- Storage directories: `uploads/`, `faiss_indices/` (auto‚Äëcreated and write‚Äëtested; falls back to `/tmp` if needed on Spaces)

## üìé Notes & Limits
- Page selection is limited to 30 pages per run to keep API and compute usage reasonable.
- If Mistral API fails after retries, topic or question generation gracefully degrades and logs an error.
- The app requires `MISTRAL_API_KEY` to be set; it will raise at startup if missing.

## üß™ Troubleshooting
- Missing key: ensure `.env` includes `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and the process can read it.
- CUDA/torch warnings: the app uses CPU for FAISS and embeddings by default; ensure versions in `requirements.txt` are installed successfully.
- Session issues on Spaces: cookies are configured for iframe usage (`SameSite=None`, `Secure=True`).
